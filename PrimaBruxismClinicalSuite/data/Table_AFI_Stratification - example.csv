AFI Category;Description;Interpretive Impact;Clinical Modulation Strategy
Comorbidities;Presence of medical conditions that may exacerbate bruxism or reduce therapeutic response.;"May require concurrent management of systemic disease; expect lower treatment efficacy.";"Start from Phase 2 in ITSL; consider dual-path therapies."
Genetic/Family History;Positive family history or genetic susceptibility to bruxism-related disorders.;"Increases diagnostic complexity; may indicate predisposition requiring longer monitoring.";"Shorten follow-up interval; increase diagnostic breadth."
Behavioral (Daytime);Daytime habits like nail-biting, jaw clenching, or chewing gum that increase muscle overload.;"Suggests muscular overload; prioritize muscular domain assessment and early EMG analysis.";"Enhance muscular interventions; lower threshold for instrument activation."
Behavioral (Nocturnal);Nocturnal behaviors or signs like tooth grinding during sleep without conscious control.;"Supports central nervous system involvement; consider polysomnography or neuro referral.";"Emphasize sleep medicine integration; adapt behavioral strategies."
Sleep Quality;Low sleep quality or reduced sleep duration, increasing bruxism severity or chronicity.;"Suggests poor prognosis; recommend psychological and behavioral interventions from Phase 1.";Integrate stress management and cognitive training early.
Environmental/Stress;Exposure to stressors or environmental triggers correlated with increased bruxism activity.;"May modulate any domain; introduce flexible therapeutic loops and close follow-up.";"Combine multi-domain observation; reinforce feedback loops."
Unclassified/Systemic;"Items flagged as aggravating but not classifiable into other categories; systemic influence likely.";"Requires clinician judgment; may imply global risk or systemic burden.";"Enable manual override; clinician-defined adaptation."
